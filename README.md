# OmniFocusScripts

This is a repository for the scripts I've built to ease my workflow with OmniFocus.

## Trello to OmniFocus

Program to bring Trello cards into Omnifocus to integrate into a GTD workflow.

Note from felixchenier, from whom I've forked this script:

> I love Trello. And I love OmniFocus.
>
> I use Trello to manage tasks and projets with my students. As soon as there are more than one person working on a project, I have a Trello board for it. But I also use OmniFocus as my main hub for managing all my personal tasks on a day to day basis. The problem is that both programs are not obvious to keep in sync.
>
> So I created this nice little javascript to fetch all the Trello cards, on all my Trello boards, that are assigned to me. These cards are then created as tasks in OmniFocus in corresponding projects. The nicest part of this script is that if a Trello card becomes completed or is not assigned to me anymore, then it becomes completed in OmniFocus. And if it becomes not-completed or becomes again assigned to me in Trello, then is also becomes not-completed in OmniFocus. Due dates are also synced.
